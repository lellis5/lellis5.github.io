 <p>This game is pretty fun and its a good game to just waste 2 hours playing with friends every so often. I cant put it any higher than 5 though because it gets repetetive after playing for a while and you need friends to have fun but overall still a pretty good game.</p>

<p>I like this game a lot and I had 10 hours on it after having it for only a few days. The combat, story, and graphics are all amazing and the only reason it isnt higher is because I havent finished it yet. </p>

<p>This is in my opinion the best tower defense game of all time. The gameplay doesnt get repetetive, the story is funny, the monkeys have interesting synergies and there are so many different upgrades between them all. The bloons series makes consistantky good games</p>

<p>This is a good game with a lot of replayability and i like roguelikes so im a bit biased but its still peak. Could easily be tied with #1</p>
