    <h2> Christmas</h2>
    <p>Christmas is my favorite holiday by far. I like winter and we get a 2 week break from school to enjoy your holday. Also seeing a tree and a bunch of presents under it is just so nice.</p>

    <h2>Thanksgiving</h2>
    <p>I love Thanksgiving and dont understand how people hate on it. We always go to my cousins house and everyone brings some food and my mom always makes cheesecake and her cheesecake is the best dessert ive ever had. Its easily better than halloween and im tired of the Thanksgiving slander</p>

    <h2>Halloween</h2>
    <p>Halloween is pretty fun you get to dress up and hang out with friends and get a bunch of candy. Also i just enjoy waling around the neighborhood in costume with my friends. I dont really know what im doing for it this year though but ill figure it out.</p>

    <h2>Easter</h2>
    <p>I actually really like easter maybe more than halloween. I go to my cousins house and they have a bunch of like challenge games to win prizes for example last year we did cup flip tic tac to where its just tic tac to but its not turned based and instead its how fast you can land a bottle flip and the winning team gets lottery tickets.</p>

    <h2>4th of July</h2>
    <p>The 4th of July is pretty cool. you get to eat some good food and watch fireworks but my family doesnt really do anything for the 4th anymore but its not  that big of a deal because its hot outside and there are mosquitos everywhere during it.</p>
